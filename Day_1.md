# Week 5 - Networking 2

Recap - A network is several devices that are connected to each other. The main purpose is to exchange data. When we say that we have a network, we have networked components. These can be categorised in several ways:


#### The Host

The main network component is the host. The host is the central point of the network. All computers that are connected to the network and participate directly in network communications are classified as a host.The term host refers to devices that are assigned an address for communication purposes.The other term for host is “end device”.

#### Server

Computer or software that provides a service to other end devices on the network. “A host that provides a service”

#### Client
A host that requests a service.


### Architecture types

This is collectively termed server-client architecture. In this, the server cannot ask the client for a service.


Other option is peer-to-peer architecture. In a peer-to-peer network, hosts can work as both a client and a server. Examples of this might be device sharing, file sharing, etc. See below:


To connect the host and client, we use intermediary device. The purpose of intermediary devices is to connect other devices on t he network. Types include:

Their primary purpose is to connect devices or to provide a function for these end devices to be connected.


### Network Media

The medium that we use to interconnect the devices. Network media include:
- Metal Wires (aka cabling)
- Fibres
- Wireless

### Network Type
Can categorise network based on:

- Size of area covered
- Number of connected users.
- Types of Services
- Area of Responsibility


### Network Infrastructure

- LAN: Local Area Network
- WAN Wide Area Network

Lan is for small geographical area, such as a house, an office, a building…

WAN is designed to provide access to other networks over wide geographical area. Generally managed by larger corporation or a telecom provider. The Internet is a collection of WANs. WANS usually used to connect several LANs together.
